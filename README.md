# imtools
Tools for creating and analyzing libraries of Black Hole images

# Dependencies
Probably nothing out of the box but who are we kidding it'll depend on pyHARM.{coordinates, geometry} eventually because screw copying them.

# Use
Say you have some images.  An entire library of images of different BH accretion flow models, taken at different times.
Maybe you want to explore overall properties of these images, or compare them.
Have I got some Python for you.
