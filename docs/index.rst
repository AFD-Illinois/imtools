Welcome to the imtools documentation!
=====================================

This is the documentation for `imtools <https://github.com/AFD-Illinois/imtools>`_, a Python package for analyzing simulated images of black holes, such as those made by `ipole <https://github.com/AFD-Illinois/imtools>`_.

You will probably be most interested in the :ref:`ref_figures`, which uses objects read with :ref:`ref_io`, but may want the functions of :ref:`image` directly.  If working with large image sets, :ref:`ref_library` may come in handy for generating statistics across the whole set in parallel.
